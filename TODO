DONE

* build system complete (basic at least) -- autotools chosen
	** still should flesh out m4/* and generally normalize

---

CURRENTLY TODO

* get DESIGN to a state I can work from it
* figure out a basic sprite and tileset collection to use
	** initial concept was mario, but it seems like a lot of work for 
		something I plan to scrap anyway
* debianize project
	** this is relatively low priority but can be done more easily early
		and maintaining it properly will help keep deps and changelog
		properly managed
* get from automake --foreign to compliant
* GPL/copyright headerize all relevant files
	** create basic vim/license/copyright header template
		*** create script to apply/update template to files given
			project name version and author info

---

MILESTONES

* basic functionality will be considered complete when PLATE can handle a game
	with requirements similar to SMB3
	** shortly after it should be able to handle SMW1

* next major target is displaying tiled layers for a level
	** PRQ:texture loading
		*** PRQ:find/load file on specified path
			**** EG: find tiles.png in 
				[$CONFDIR/override/textures,$BASEDIR/textures,$BASEDIR/../textures/,$BASEDIR/,$CWD/textures,$CWD/]
* then comes basic player interaction with the level's control layer
	** PRQ:configured input-event::control-event mappig
		*** PRQ:configuration load/save/definition
		*** PRQ:control-event implementation
		*** PRQ:event pump
			**** pull SDL events into PLATE queue
			**** dispatch PLATE queue to listeners
		*** transform raw SDL input events configurably into synthetic PLATE
			control events
