* actually pick and set up a build system, build.sh is dumb. - not in milestones

* milestone 1 will be to init an sdl/ogl window and paint some portion of a mario tileset nabbed from the interwebs
* milestone 2 will be defined asap.
* milestone N is to have the basic dynamics of mario working, this is considered a bare minimum not a primary target
