PLATE OpenGL PLATform Engine

* DESIGN RATIONALE/ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENT
	** THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, THESE ENTRIES ARE NOT FINALIZED

* initial target is 2D simple textured sprites & tileset bg/fg layers
* classes of things we need then are:
	** event pump
		*** pull from SDL event queue
		*** transform raw SDL events into synthetic PLATE events
		*** also transmits PLATE events generated by game interaction
		*** event handlers are objects that implement a specific interface
			(in C++ this would mean inheriting a specific virtual base class)
		*** XXX with event transformation/synthesis it would be trivial to
			accidentally generate an event feedback loop
		*** event pump and handlers are likely to want to run in another thread
			**** this means event handlers need to lock objects to update properties
			**** perhaps objects can have their own internal event pumps to pick up atomically
				enqueued alterations and react to them
			**** this would also suggests objects currently handling an event such as ::render
				could be interrupted in such a way as to be forced to dump their current
				context and pulled back to realtime?
	** simple display layers with optional parallax scale
		*** one tileset per layer, unlimited layers, mix tilesets by mixing layers and empty spots
	** control layer
		*** this is not a draw layer (except perhaps in a debug mode)
		*** this layer defines "edges" and is 1:1 parallax by definition
			**** initial support will be for simply standard edge-of-block edges
			**** blocks will be enterable from / impassable from each edge as bits in the cell
		*** this layer is also the owner of grid-attached objects, including:
			**** warp edges
			**** warp doors
			**** activateable blocks
			**** moving (scripted) platforms
			**** other interactive blocks (falling platforms, bounce blocks, etc.)
	** non-layer objects
		*** player
			**** control-bound/grid-free:interactive
		*** enemies/mobs
			**** control-bound/grid-free:scripted
			**** scripted behaviour, interact with control layer
		*** items
			**** control-bound/grid-free:physical
			**** basic behaviour, can be picked up and carried or otherwise manipulated but do not move on their own
		*** special blocks
			**** control-component:player/grid-bound
			**** these have special interactions beyond simple edges
		*** movable edges
			**** control-component:all/grid-relative:scripted
			**** these are both scripted moving platforms and things like timeout-fall or dis/reappearing floor
			**** these have predictable grid-oriented behaviour but are not *strictly* grid-bound
		*** warp edges, warp blocks(doors)
			**** control-component:player/grid-bound
			**** these are either on-collide or activatable grid-bound objects that send the player elsewhere
